# Linkedin : Retro-conception zoning

## Part 1 : GUI Design Process

### Overview
This brief outlines the key steps in the graphical user interface (GUI) design process, with a focus on zoning. First thing first, I'm gonna need to define some terms of the design process to fully understand the interface conception.

## Interface Conception Process (GUI)

### 1. Zoning
Zoning is the first step in GUI design where the layout is divided into functional zones. These zones represent different areas like navigation, content, and sidebars. Zoning helps designers organize content to ensure optimal usability.

### 2. Wireframing
Wireframes are basic blueprints of the interface that define the placement of elements such as buttons, menus, and images. Wireframes focus on functionality and layout rather than aesthetics. They provide a clear view of the user flow and how users will interact with the interface.

### 3. Graphical Mockup
A graphical mockup is a detailed and visually accurate representation of the user interface. It includes the use of colors, fonts, images, and other visual elements. This step allows everyone to visualize the final design before any development.

### 4. Static Mockup (Integrated Mockup)
A static mockup, also known as an integrated mockup, is a non-interactive visual representation of the interface. It combines all the graphical elements but remains static. This type of mockup is useful for finalizing the design layout without adding any interactive components.

### 5. Prototyping
Prototyping is the creation of an interactive version of the interface. It allows designers and developers to test the user experience by simulating interactions such as button clicks, navigation, and other dynamic elements.

### Graphic Design Guide (Style Guide)
The graphic design guide or style guide is a document that outlines the visual rules and guidelines for the product's design. It ensures that all elements, from colors to typography, are used consistently across the interface. A typical style guide includes:

- Color Palette: A predefined set of colors used throughout the interface.
- Typography: Guidelines for font usage, including headings, body text, and emphasis.
- Logo and Icons: Instructions for logo placement and the use of icons.
- Spacing and Layout: Guidelines for maintaining consistent padding, margins, and alignment.

The graphic design guide is introduced during the graphical mockup stage to ensure consistency in visual design and branding.

This concludes this first part on the different phases of the construction of the graphical user interface.

## Part Two Zoning Linkedin's Home Page
Now that we have defined the different phases of the user interface creation process, I will focus on the first step which is zoning.
Here the zoning will be done by reverse engineering (witch means zoning on an already existing application) on the main page of LinkedIn.
Linkedin being a responsive / adaptive application, zoning must be done on different screen formats (desktop, tablet and smartphone).
